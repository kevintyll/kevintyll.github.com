                <p>Drexel Labs is a team of misfits, living on an island in the Artic Circle.  We fix broken toys, study up on the latest dentistry practices and write a few websites and iPhone applications in our spare time.</p>

                <p>We've been working together as a team since early 2007 and have done a few really nice websites and are now expanding into iPhone applications as well.  ICanHazBinky.com is our first "fun" site, and we're excited to share it.  We're also kind of excited to use it too!  iCalorie was inspired by Brian's wife, who runs more by 9 a.m. than most people run all year.</p>

                        Kevin is a code ninja.  He writes in haiku, using the absolute fewest lines of code possible.<br /><br />
                        <pre>
        Ruby in the night
        Is the programmer's delight
        Bring me my laptop

        ...and a can of Red Bull
                        </pre>
                        <p>Kevin enjoys walks on the beach, sunsets, and a cool breeze on his face.</p>

                        <p>When not going ninja on some code, he spends his time with his wife and 3 beautiful girls in Riverview, FL.  That's right, 3 girls.  You can find pictures of them on <a href="http://www.icanhazbinky.com" target="blank">icanhazbinky?</a></p>
                        <p>Please have fun with our sites and applications, that's why we created them!</p>
